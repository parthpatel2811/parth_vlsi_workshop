# 1.Introduction
OpenLane is an open-source ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) flow that facilitates the design and implementation of digital integrated circuits. It provides a complete RTL-to-GDSII (Register Transfer Level to Graphic Data System II) flow, leveraging various open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools. Developed by Efabless Corporation.
